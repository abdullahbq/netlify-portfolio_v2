### Hey There!

My name is Tim Smith and I'm a front end web developer. I build responsive websites using modern technologies like React, Vue, Sass, Git, as well as good old jQuery. I also have experience with PHP and Wordpress as a CMS platform.

When I'm not building things for the web, I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter who always know how to have fun. I also attend online classes for my AAS in Web Development, which I will be receiving in 2019.

Although I'm a front end developer I like challenges of all sorts so if you are looking for someone to work with, use the fancy contact form to get in touch!
