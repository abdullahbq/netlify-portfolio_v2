As a web developer, burn out is a very real concern. It's something that isn't talked about much, so today I'll talk about my experience and how to avoid it.

In the development world, there is a general attitude that you should always be developing. While I agree with this to some extent, it can also become very helpful and counter-productive when taken too far. Too much of a good thing is bad, and web development is no exception.

Sometimes people keep pushing it and reach a point of burn out. I want to talk about how to recognize and avoid burn out before it becomes too big of a problem to handle.

## What is burn out?

Burn out is like a race car barreling down the track as they see a turn coming. The race car can either slow down and take the turn or it can keep going straight and run into a wall. Becoming burnt out is like running into the wall instead of temporarily slowing down and adapting to the environment.

Unfortunately, too many people find this out when it is too late and things get worse and worse. To make things worse, it hasn't been a very talked about issue until recently. Many people are still unaware of this situation so they don't even know to watch out for it.

Time, energy, and even willpower is limited and even the most disciplined person can reach the limits at times. It is when we feel ourselvers approachimg those limits and decide to keep going that we reach the point of exhaustion and deprivation. Fortunately, there are ways to see this coming, prepare for it, and even prevent it.

## Why do people hit the wall?

I work full-time as a web developer. I also maintain my blog, have my portfolio website (which is always a work in progress), freelance regularly, and go to school for web development. This is all in addition to networking with other developers, listening to web development podcasts, and reading books and articles about web development to keep up with changing technologies.

It sounds like a lot, and it is. But it's not unusual. There are a lot of web developers who do at least as much as I do, if not more. I want to be clear here though: not spending all of your time doing web development isn't bad. It's actually probably healthier for a lot of reasons. The problem with doing all of these things comes when we become so deep in web development that we are starting to lose touch with the world around us.

This recently happened to me because of all of the projects I'm working on. I felt like my life consisted of getting kids ready for school, web development for 8 hours, then dinner and homework with the kids, then 5 more hours of web develoment every day. It gets really exhausting really fast. There are some ways to see it coming and prepare for it though.

## How to see burn out coming

The best advice I can give to see burn out coming is to really be honest with yourself. It sounds really clich√©, but our careers as web developers are marathons not sprints. Because it's a marathon, we want to make our career last long-term and there will be times to slow down considerably and other times to speed up a little because it's a straightaway and things are lining up perfectly.

If we aren't honest with ourselves, we won't be able to see our situation. We could miss how isolated we've become or how bent out of shape we get. It's a very good thing to know where we stand because it tells us when we need a break to get back to our normal selves. A lot of times people are too hard on themselves and it's easy to feel like we aren't doing enough.

Just know that this isn't true. You are doing enough. You are doing a good job. It's okay to take a break sometimes.

## What to do when you reach that point

When I reach the point of burn out, I do my work for my full-time job and that's it. I usually end up taking one to two weeks off from everything else. Even if I have freelance projects, homework, or personal projects I make sure to take a break. When figuring out a schedule for a project I allow for some extra time in the event something like this happens.

The reality is that self-care is much more important than any job or paycheck. In my opinion, I'd rather take two weeks off and make it up when I'm feeling reenergized than keep pushing through when I dread doing it every time I sit down at my computer. I've ready too many stories about developers who reached this point and kept pushing until they eventually quit web development all together.
