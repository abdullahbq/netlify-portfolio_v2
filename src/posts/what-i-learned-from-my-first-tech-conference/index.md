I recently attended my first tech conference. In this article I'll talk about what I learned, what to expect, and how to prepare to have a great time!

If you've ever thought about attending a conference, meetup, or workshop or you're signed up to attend one, this article is for you! I'll talk about experiences I had at my first conference, things I'm glad I did, and things I wish I had done. Hopefully this will help you get the most out of your first (or next) event.

## A Little About Me

I'd like to start by saying that I'm an introvert. When I took the Myers-Briggs test, I learned I'm an INFJ, which in short is a person who can be very social but then needs alone time for a while. I'm the kind of guy who walks around work with headphones on, even if I'm not listening to something just so people don't try to make small talk with me. In a work setting, I have no problem with talking to people and working as part of a team. Socially, meeting new people is uncomfortable at best.

### The Team I Got To Go With

My employer recently sent me to attend DrupalCon in Seattle, WA along with my team (consisting of my boss Andy and another developer named Griffin). I've been in this position for about 6 months, and in that time have gotten to know the two others on my team fairly well in a work context and we've even gone out a few times for drinks and arcade games.

I've never travelled for work or even gone on trips with anyone other than family. I really had no idea what to expect for this 5 day trip with co-workers. Fortunately, the guys I work with are pretty cool and laid-back which made everything much easier than it could have been.

## Day 1: Getting to Seattle

We all met at our local airport around 6:15am to get ready for our flight. We were flying to Minneapolis and then to Seattle. I'd never been to Seattle, but in high school I was really into Nirvana and then later Death Cab for Cutie so I had a little familiarity with the city and their musical history.

As a quick side note, if you're looking for stuff to do on a flight: I highly recommend downloading some podcasts. They're free, you can get hours' worth of material, and there are podcasts about most subjects. A few I recommend are [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/), [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/), [Sneak Attack](https://sneakpodcast.com/), or any number of true crime podcasts. I spent a lot my plane ride listening to [Cold](https://thecoldpodcast.com/), which coincidentally happened in Seattle.

We arrived in Seattle around 10:30am and made our way to the hotel. Our hotel was right next to the conference center and within walking distance of a lot of things, so after getting everything dropped off, we decided to go adventuring a bit.

We stretched our legs and started looking for some lunch, when we came across a bar with some seafood and american food. We had lunch and decided to keep exploring the downtown area. We found the Pike Place Market and wanted to see more of that. First we found the infamous gum wall where Griffin had to get some pictures. In case you're unfamiliar with this (I hadn't ever heard of it), it's a little tunnel where people have stuck their used gum for quite some time.

After wandering through this hall, we came across [a brewery](https://www.pikebrewing.com/) and decided to relax for a bit. We talked about everything from Drupal to movies and comic books. We stayed there and talked for a few hours before deciding to seek out some dinner. We'd heard of the Pink Door but found out it was really busy so we wouldn't be able to eat there. While we were making our way to the Pink Door, we found a little indian restaurant and decided to eat there. I hadn't ever had indian food but made it a sort of mantra that I was going to try new things on this trip.

I liked the indian food a lot and we had great conversation. Our previous conversations continued as we talked about travel, various programming languages, and what we wanted to do while we were in Seattle. After dinner, we decided to call it a night since we'd been travelling and exploring all day.

## Day 2: First Training

Monday started early for me since I was still on midwest time. I woke up and started getting ready. Even had time to get my room picked up and watch some tv before heading to my first training.

I've only been working in Drupal for about 6 months at this point and even then, it's in Drupal 7. We're looking to move to Drupal 8 this year, so the class I took on Monday was Module Development with Mike Anello from [DrupalEasy](https://www.drupaleasy.com/). I learned a lot and even made a couple of new friends (one of whom was in the training with me).

After our trainings had wrapped up Andy, Griffin, and I went to go find dinner. After some debate, we ended up going to a sushi restaurant. I've never cared for sushi but decided this trip was about trying new things so I went with it. We got sashimi and a bunch of rolls to share. What do you know? I liked it a lot. I even got it on my birthday after we got back home. We wandered around a bit more and then headed back to the hotel.

## Day 3: Second Training

Tuesday started much like Monday had. My training for Tuesday was the Absolute Beginners Guide to Drupal 8. Initially we had thought this would be about some basic theming and coding for Drupal 8, but as it turns out it was more geared toward basic users and a lot of review for me. It was taught by Steve Burge of [OSTraining](https://www.ostraining.com/) who I thought did a great job. A lot of people seemed to learn a lot who were new to Drupal.

Even though I didn't learn a ton of new stuff from this training, that doesn't mean it was worthless. We did get a book which covered each topic from the training in depth. I also got to see how he taught and how the others in my training learned which could not only be valuable when I give talks in the future, but also to help explain these things to potential new team members who may not be familiar with Drupal.

##Conclusion

Tech conferences, meetups, or camps can seem like a very initimdating thing. There is a lot of knowledge to be gained from attending and a lot of people to meet. I highly encourage anyone interested in trying one out to do so.
